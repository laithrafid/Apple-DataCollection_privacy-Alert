## DESCRIPTION
This CIS Script built to report and remediate based on the your organisation score.

## Info
While working with CIS Benchmarks (Remediation Scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt this could be done better, faster and easier.
The guys from the [macOS Security Compliance Project](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security) did an amazing job automating the guidance and configuration profiles.
p
I created custom rules set for *[CIS Benchmark](https://downloads.cisecurity.org/#/)* to integrate with the macOS Security Compliance Project and published [CIS-macOS-Security](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-macOS-Security).

While working with **CIS Benchmark**, **Script** and **Configuration Profile**, I had the feeling there was missing a overview with compleet reporting, and there for build a read only CIS-Reporting script you can find [here](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Reporting)

Ended up with seperate tools, creation of the **Documention**, **Configuration Profiles** and **Reporting**. However I still needed an extra script for remediation.

To resolve this I combined the reporting script with remediation with the option to enable remediation or not. 

For easy maintaining, the CIS-Script is built-in Fragments. There is a `Header.sh`, `Footer.sh`, `Version.sh` and an folder **OrgScore** filled with seperate `OrgScore*.sh`. This way it's easier to focus on a specifiek rule.

To assemble all the fragements together in a Script you can use standalone or via an MDM server (like Jamf Pro) you can use the `Assemble.sh` script. After assembling the Remediation Script, standalone it will preform a read only check and creates a full report. 

```bash
$ sudo ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh
```
*Location of the report `/Library/Security/Reports/`*

If you use the script via a MDM you can set the script to create a short or full report, and enable or disable remediation.

## Usage/Requirements
*The CIS-Script is tested on macOS Big Sur 11.*

* Test OrgScore*.sh
* Assembled Remediation Script
* Upload CIS Benchmark Settings Configuration Profile
* Configure CIS Configuration Profiles.
* Extension Attributes [Jamf Pro Server](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Script/tree/main/Jamf/EA)


### Test OrgScore*.sh
For adjustments, you can test every OrgScore seperatly.

```bash
$ cd /Git/CIS-Script/Fragments/OrgScores
$ sudo ./OrgScore*.sh
```

### Assemble Remediation Script
The `Assemble.sh` will default build the full Remediation Script `CISBenchmarkScript.sh`.

```bash
$ ./Assemble.sh
```

If you want you can create seperate script by running the script with argument

```bash
$ ./Assemble.sh -s
```
you can find the build in `./Build/` folder

Upload this into your MDM Server. With Jamf Pro you can create a policy, Trigger *check-in* Frequency *once a day* add the Script, include inventory update (to report result within Extension Attributes). Scope to the target devices.

### Upload CIS Benchmark Settings Configuration Profile 
Configure an Configration Profile, see example, and if you using Jamf Pro, you can use the **[Jamf Pro Custom Schema.json](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Script/blob/main/Jamf/Jamf%20Pro%20Custom%20Schema.json)** to configure the reporting and remediation and scoring. Scope the CIS Benchmark Settings Profile to the target devices.

### Configure CIS Configuration Profiles. 
Setup the needed Configuration Profiles for the CIS Benchmarks rules you scoring on with your MDM server or generated them with the **[CIS-macOS-Security](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-macOS-Security)** integrated with the macOS Security Compliance Project. Scope to the target devices.

### Extension Attributes [Jamf Pro Server](https://github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Script/tree/main/Jamf/EA)
Upload the Extension Atrributes into you Jamf Pro Server.
