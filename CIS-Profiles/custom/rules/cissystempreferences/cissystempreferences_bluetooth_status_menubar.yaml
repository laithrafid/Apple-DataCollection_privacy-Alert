title: "Show Bluetooth status in menu bar"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  By showing the Bluetooth status in the menu bar, a small Bluetooth icon is placed in the menu bar. This icon quickly shows the status of Bluetooth, and can allow the user to quickly turn Bluetooth on or off.
  
  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Enabling "Show Bluetooth status in menu bar" is a security awareness method that helps understand the current state of Bluetooth, including whether it is enabled, Discoverable, what paired devices exist and are currently active.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Bluetooth is a useful wireless tool that has been widely exploited when configured improperly. The user should have insight into the Bluetooth status.

  [NOTE] 
  ====
  The check and fix are for the currently logged in user. To get the currently logged in user, run the following.
  [source,bash]
  ----
  CURRENT_USER=$( scutil <<< "show State:/Users/ConsoleUser" | awk '/Name :/ && ! /loginwindow/ { print $3 }' )
