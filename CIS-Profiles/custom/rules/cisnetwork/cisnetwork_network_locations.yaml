title: 'Create network specific locations (Manual)'
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  The network location feature of the Mac is a very powerful tool to manage network security. By creating different network locations, a user can easily (and without administrative privileges) change the network settings on the Mac. By only using the network interfaces needed at any specific time, exposure to network attacks is limited.
  
  A little understanding of how the Network System Preferences pane works is required.

  ==== Rationale:
  Network locations allow the computer to have specific configurations ready for network access when required. Locations can be used to manage which network interfaces are available for specialized network access

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Unneeded network interfaces increase the attack surface and could lead to a successful exploit.
