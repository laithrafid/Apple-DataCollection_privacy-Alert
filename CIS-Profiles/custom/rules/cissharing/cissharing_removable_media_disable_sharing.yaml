title: "Disable DVD or CD Sharing"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  DVD or CD Sharing allows users to remotely access the system's optical drive. While Apple does not ship Macs with built-in optical drives any longer, external optical drives are still recognized when they are connected. In testing the sharing of an external optical drive persists when a drive is reconnected.

  ==== Rationale:
  Disabling DVD or CD Sharing minimizes the risk of an attacker using the optical drive as a vector for attack and exposure of sensitive data.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Many Apple devices are now sold without optical drives and drive sharing may be needed for legacy optical media. The media should be explicitly re-shared as needed rather than using a persistent share. Necessary data from optical drives should be copied or images so that the original optical drives are for long term storage only.
