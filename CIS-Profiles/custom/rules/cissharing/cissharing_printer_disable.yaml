  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  By enabling Printer sharing the computer is set up as a print server to accept print jobs from other computers. Dedicated print servers or direct IP printing should be used instead.
  
  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Disabling Printer Sharing mitigates the risk of attackers attempting to exploit the print server to gain access to the system.
