  ==== Description:
  Apple Events is a technology that allows one program to communicate with other programs. Remote Apple Events allows a program on one computer to communicate with a program on a different computer.
  
  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Disabling Remote Apple Events mitigates the risk of an unauthorized program gaining access to the system.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  With remote Apple events turned on, an AppleScript program running on another Mac can interact with the local computer.
