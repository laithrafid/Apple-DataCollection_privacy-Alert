title: "Ensure EFI version is valid and being regularly checked (Automated)"

  ==== Description:
  In order to mitigate firmware attacks Apple has created an automated Firmware check to ensure that the EFI version running is a known good version from Apple. There is also an automated process to check it every seven days.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  If the Firmware of a computer has been compromised the Operating System that the Firmware loads cannot be trusted either.

  [discrete]
  ==== Audit:
  Verify that the computer does not have a
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck/eficheck --integrity-check
  ----
  The output should include Primary allowlist version match found. No changes detected in primary hashes. as well as the model and version in this format MBP133.xxx.xxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxxx.
  
  An Apple T2 Security Chip will case this check to give the following output:
  ReadBinaryFromKernel: No matching services found. Either this system is not supported by eficheck, or you need to re-load the kext IntegrityCheck: couldn't get EFI contents from kext
  Run this command to verify that the machine does have an Apple T2 Security Chip:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPiBridgeDataType | /usr/bin/grep "T2" 
  
  Model Name: Apple T2 Security Chip
  ----
  Either state is compliant.
  Run this command to verify that the efi check system daemon is running (including machines with the T2 chip):
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl list | /usr/bin/grep com.apple.driver.eficheck 
  
  Result: -     0     com.apple.driver.eficheck
  ----
check: |
  /usr/libexec/firmwarecheckers/eficheck/eficheck --integrity-check 
result:
  integer: 1
fix: |
  If EFI does not pass the integrity check you may send a report to Apple. Backing up files and clean installing a known good Operating System and Firmware is recommended.
