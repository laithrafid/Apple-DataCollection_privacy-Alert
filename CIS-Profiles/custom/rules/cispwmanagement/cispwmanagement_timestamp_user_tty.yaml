title: "Use a separate timestamp for each user/tty combo (Automated)"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  Using tty tickets ensures that a user must enter the sudo password in each Terminal session.
  
  With sudo versions 1.8 and higher, introduced in 10.12, the default value is to have tty tickets for each interface so that root access is limited to a specific terminal. The default configuration can be overwritten or not configured correctly on earlier versions of macOS.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  In combination with removing the sudo timeout grace period, a further mitigation should be in place to reduce the possibility of a background process using elevated rights when a user elevates to root in an explicit context or tty.
  
  Additional mitigation should be in place to reduce the risk of privilege escalation of background processes.
 
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  This control should have no user impact. Developers or installers may have issues if background processes are spawned with different interfaces than where sudo was executed.

  ==== Audit:
  Run the following commands to verify that the default sudoers controls are in place with explicit tickets per tty.
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep -E -s '!tty_tickets' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*
  ----
  Nothing should be returned
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/grep -E -s 'timestamp_type' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*
  ----
  Ensure that nothing is returned or that the output does not include timestamp_type=ppid or timestamp_type=global

check: |
  /usr/bin/grep -c tty_tickets /etc/sudoers
result:
  boolean: 1

  [source,bash]
  ----
  /usr/bin/sudo sed -i '.old' '/Default !tty_tickets/d' /etc/sudoers && /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod 644 /etc/sudoers && /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown root:wheel /etc/sudoers
