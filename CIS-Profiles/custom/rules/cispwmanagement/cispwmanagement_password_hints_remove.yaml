  ==== Description:
  Password hints help the user recall their passwords for various systems and/or accounts. In most cases, password hints are simple and closely related to the user's password.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Password hints that are closely related to the user's password are a security vulnerability, especially in the social media age. Unauthorized users are more likely to guess a user's password if there is a password hint. The password hint is very susceptible to social engineering attacks and information exposure on social media networks

  ==== Audit:
  Run the following command to verify that no users has a password hint:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo dscl . -list /Users/"$CURRENT_USER" hint
  ----

  The output will list all users. If there are any text listed with the user, then the machine is not compliant
  example:
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo dscl . -list /Users hint
  firstuser passwordhint 
  seconduser passwordhint2 
  thirduser
  fourthuser
  Guest
  ----
check: |
  /usr/bin/dscl . -read /Users/"$CURRENT_USER" hint | /usr/bin/grep -c "hint"
result:
  boolean: 0
fix: |
  For each user, run the following to turn the Wi-Fi status on in the menu bar
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo dscl . -delete /Users/"$CURRENT_USER" hint
