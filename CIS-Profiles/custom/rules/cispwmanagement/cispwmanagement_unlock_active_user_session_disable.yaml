title: "Ensure an administrator account cannot login to another user's active and locked session (Automated)"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  macOS has a privilege that can be granted to any user that will allow that user to unlock active user's sessions.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Disabling the admins and/or user's ability to log into another user's active and locked session prevents unauthorized persons from viewing potentially sensitive and/or personal information.
  
  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  While Fast user switching is a workaround for some lab environments especially where there is even less of an expectation of privacy this setting change may impact some maintenance workflows
