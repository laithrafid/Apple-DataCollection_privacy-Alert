title: "Check System Wide Applications for appropriate permissions (Automated)"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  Applications in the System Applications Directory (/Applications) should be world executable since that is their reason to be on the system. They should not be world- writable and allow any process or user to alter them for other processes or users to then execute modified versions

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Unauthorized modifications of applications could lead to the execution of malicious code.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Applications changed will no longer be world-writable

  ==== Audit:
check: |
  /usr/bin/find /Applications -iname "*.app" -type d -perm -2 -ls | /usr/bin/grep -c .app
result:
  integer: 0
fix: |
  [source,bash]
  ----
  IFS=$'\n'
  for apps in $( /usr/bin/find /Applications -iname "*\.app" -type d -perm -2 ); do
    /bin/chmod -R o-w "$apps"
  done
  unset IFS
