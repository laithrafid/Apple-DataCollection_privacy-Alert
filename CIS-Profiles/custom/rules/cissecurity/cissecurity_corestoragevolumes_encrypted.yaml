title: "Ensure all user storage CoreStorage volumes are encrypted"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Apple introduced Core Storage with 10.7. It is used as the default for formatting on macOS volumes prior to 10.13.

  All HFS and Core Storage Volumes should be encrypted  

  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  In order to protect user data from loss or tampering volumes carrying data should be encrypted

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  While FileVault protects the boot volume data may be copied to other attached storage and reduce the protection afforded by FileVault. Ensure all user volumes are encrypted to protect data.

  ==== Audit:
check: |
  LFV=$(/usr/sbin/diskutil cs list | grep "Logical Volume Family" | awk '/Logical Volume Family/ {print $5}')

  /usr/sbin/diskutil cs "$LFV" | awk '/Conversion Status/ {print $3}'
result:
  string: Complete
