  ==== Description:
  Software vendors release security patches and software updates for their products when security vulnerabilities are discovered. There is no simple way to complete this action without a network connection to an Apple software repository. Please ensure appropriate access for this control. This check is only for what Apple provides through software update.

  Software updates should be run at minimum every 30 days. Run the following command yo verify when software update was previously ran: 
  [source,bash]
  ----
  $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate | grep -e LastFullSuccessfulDate
  ----
  The response should be in the last 30 days (Example): 
  [source,bash]
  ----
  LastFullSuccessfulDate = "2020-07-30 12:45:25 +0000";
  ----

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  It is important that these updates be applied in a timely manner to prevent unauthorized persons from exploiting the identified vulnerabilities.

  [IMPORTANT]
  ====
  Missing patches can lead to more exploit opportunities.

  /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --list | grep -c "*"
