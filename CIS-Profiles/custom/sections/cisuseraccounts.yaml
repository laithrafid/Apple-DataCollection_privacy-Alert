  name: "User Accounts and Environment"
  description: |
    Account management is a central part of security for any computer system including macOS. General practices should be followed to ensure that all accounts on a system are still needed and that default accounts have been removed. Users with admin roles should have distinct accounts for Admin functions as well as day to day work where the passwords are different and known only by the user assigned to the account. Accounts with Elevated privileges should not be easily discerned from the account name from standard accounts.
    
    When any computer system is added to a Directory System there are additional controls available including user account management that are not available in a standalone computer. One of the drawbacks is the local computer is no longer in control of the accounts that can access or manage it if given permission. For macOS if the computer is connected to a Directory any standard user can now login to the computer at console which by default may be desirable or not depending on the use case. If an admin group is allowed to administer the local computer the membership of that group is controlled completely in the Directory.
    
    macOS computers connected to a Directory should be configured so that the risk is appropriate for the mission use of the computer. Only those accounts that require local authentication should be allowed, only required administrator accounts should be in the local administrator group. Authenticated Users for console access and Domain Admins for Administration may be too broad or too limited
